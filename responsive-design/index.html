                "But I will be very happy to show in this discourse what paths I have followed and to represent my life in it as if in a picture, so that everyone 
                may judge it for himself; and that, learning from the common response the opinions one will have of it, this may be a new means of teaching myself, 
                which I shall add to those that I am accustomed to using."<sup>1</sup>

                But what I want to emphasize is the fact that I was fumbling rather than working according to plan and already arrived-at convictions. When you 
                start any book, you don't know what, ultimately, your issues are. You try to write to find them. You're fiddling with the stuff, hoping to make 
                sense, whatever kind of sense you can make.<sup>2</sup>

                "As your perspective of the world increases not only is the pain it inflicts on you less but also its meaning. Understanding the world requires you 
                to take a certain distance from it. Things that are too small to see with the naked eye, such as molecules and atoms, we magnify. Things that are 
                too large, such as cloud formations, river deltas, constellations, we reduce. At length we bring it within the scope of our senses and we stabilize 
                it with fixer. When it has been fixed we call it knowledge. Throughout our childhood and teenage years, we strive to attain the correct distance to 
                objects and phenomena. We read, we learn, we experience, we make adjustments. Then one day we reach the point where all the necessary distances have 
                been set, all the necessary systems have been put in place. That is when time begins to pick up speed. It no longer meets any obstacles, everything 
                is set, time races through our lives, the days pass by in a flash and before we know what is happening we are forty, fifty, sixty . . . Meaning 
                requires content, content requires time, time requires resistance. Knowledge is distance, knowledge is stasis and the enemy of meaning."<sup>3</sup>
