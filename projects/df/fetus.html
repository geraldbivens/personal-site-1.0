            The word 'fetus' in this definition refers to a human offspring at
            any stage of its prenatal development, from conception to birth.
            There is a narrower medical sense of the word 'fetus' in which it
            refers to the unborn entity from roughly the eighth week of
            pregnancy (when brain waves can first be monitored) until birth,
            normally at nine months. In this technical sense the word 'fetus' is
            used to contrast the relatively mature unborn being with its earlier
            stages when it is called a zygote (from conception to implantation a
            week later in the uterine wall) or an embryo (from implantation
            until the eighth week).<sup>1</sup>
