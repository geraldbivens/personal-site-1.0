            The term 'objective' is defined by antiessentialists not in terms of
            a relation to intrinsic features of objects but rather by reference
            to relative ease of attaining consensus among inquirers. Just as the
            appearance-reality distinction is replaced by distinctions between
            relative utility of descriptions, so the objective-subjective
            distinction is replaced by distinctions between relative ease in
            getting agreement.<sup>1</sup>
