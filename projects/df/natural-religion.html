            In the Preface, Pamphilus tells us that the dialogue will be about
            natural religion, in contrast to revealed religion. The latter is
            any religion based on the belief that a deity has revealed himself
            and his will to mankind, whereas natural religion is religion based
            upon rational and scientific evidence and reasonings. It is taken as
            obvious and certain in natural religion that God exists; what will
            be explored is God's Nature and His Providential plans.<sup>1</sup>

            Happily, these circumstances are all to be found in the subject of
            <em>NATURAL RELIGION</em>. What truth so obvious, so certain, as the
            <em>being</em> of a God, which the most ignorant ages have
            acknowledged, for which the most refined geniuses have ambitiously
            striven to produce new proofs and arguments? What truth so important
            as this, which is the ground of all our hopes, the surest foundation
            of morality, the firmest support of society, and the only principle
            which ought never to be a moment absent from our thoughts and
            meditations? But, in treating of this obvious and important truth,
            what obscure questions occur concerning the <em>nature</em> of that
            Divine Being; his attributes, his decrees, his plan of providence?
            These have been always subjected to the disputations of men:
            Concerning these, human reason has not reached any certain
            determination. But these are topics so interesting that we cannot
            restrain our restless inquiry with regard to them; though nothing
            but doubt, uncertainty, and contradiction have as yet been the
            result of our most accurate researches.<sup>2</sup>
