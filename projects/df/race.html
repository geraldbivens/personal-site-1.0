            The effort must be made to understand race as an unstable and
            "decentered" complex of social meanings constantly being tranformed
            by political struggle. With this in mind, let us propose a
            definition:
            <em
              >race is a concept which signifies and symbolizes social conflicts
              and interests by referring to different types of human bodies</em
            >. Although the concept of race invokes biologically based human
            characteristics (so-called "phenotypes"), selection of these
            particular human features for purposes of racial signification is
            always and necessarily a social and historical process. In contrast
            to the other major distinction of this type, that of gender, there
            is no biological basis for distinguishing among human groups along
            the lines of race.<sup>1</sup>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <sup>1</sup> This is not to suggest that gender is a biological
            category while race is not. Gender, like race, is a social
            construct. However, the biological division of humans into
            sexes&mdash;two at least, and possibly intermediate ones as
            well&mdash;is not in dispute. This provides a basis for argument
            over gender divisions&mdash;how "natural," etc.&mdash;which does not
            exist with regard to race. To ground an argument for the "natural"
            existence of race, one must resort to philosophical anthropology.

            Races exist only in relation to one another. Whiteness is
            meaningless in the absence of Blackness; the same holds in reverse.
            Moreover, race itself would be meaningless if it were not a fault
            line along which power, prestige, and respect are distributed.
            ...While ethnicity determines culture, race determines social
            position. Although the members of a given ethnic group may, for a
            time, find themselves on the bottom by virtue of their recent
            arrival, their lack of language or job skills, or even because of
            rank discrimination, that position usually is not long-term.
            <em>Race</em> and hierarchy, however, are indelibly wed.
