            It is hard for man to understand this, because he persists in
            identifying himself with his will, his power over the animal
            organism, with brute force. Now the organism is only an instrument
            of thought. But the identity of a man consists in the consistency of
            what he does and thinks, and <em>consistency</em> is the
            intellectual character of a thing; that is, is its expressing
            something.<sup>1</sup>
