            Sensations are not parts of <em>any</em> knowledge, good or bad,
            superior or inferior, imperfect or complete. They are rather
            provocations, incitements, challenges to an act of inquiry which is
            to <em>terminate</em> in knowledge. They are not ways of knowing
            things inferior in value to reflective ways, to the ways that
            require thought and inference, because they are not ways of knowing
            at all. They are stimuli to reflection and inference. . . .
            Sensation is thus, as the sensationalist claimed, the beginning of
            knowledge, but only in the sense that the experienced shock of
            change is the necessary stimulus to the investigating and comparing
            which eventually produced knowledge.<sup>1</sup>
