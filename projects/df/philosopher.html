            To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even
            to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its
            dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and
            trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only
            theoretically, but practically.<sup>1</sup>

            The question, What is a philosopher? cannot be answered at all in
            more recent times. Here he appears as an accidental, solitary
            wanderer, as a daring "genius." What is he in the midst of a
            powerful culture that is not based on solitary "geniuses"? ...How
            does a people consider the philosopher? What relation does he have
            to the culture? Now he shows himself as genius, like artists,
            solitary. The Republic of Geniuses.<sup>2</sup>
