            A <em>necessary condition</em> is a condition that, if lacking,
            guarantees that a statement is false (or that a phenomenon will not
            occur). Thus, <em>Fido's being an animal</em> is a necessary
            condition for <em>Fido's being a dog</em>, for if Fido is not an
            animal, then he is not a dog. The consequent (then-clause) of a true
            conditional statement provides a necessary condition for the truth
            of the antecedent (if-clause).<sup>1</sup>

            A necessary condition for some state of affairs S is a condition
            that must be satisfied in order for S to obtain.

            For example, a necessary condition for getting an A in 341 is that a
            student hand in a term paper. This means that if a student does not
            hand in a term paper, then a student will not get an A, or,
            equivalently, if a student gets an A, then a student hands in a term
            paper.<sup>2</sup>
