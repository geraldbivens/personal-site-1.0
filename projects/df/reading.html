            Reading is not an alternative to seeing but (as its root in a word
            for advising suggests) an effort to detail a way of seeing something
            more clearly, an interpretation of how things look and why they
            appear as, and in the order, they do. ...A reading, like any
            recitation, is by all means to be checked for its accuracy. It
            should be thought of as an argument, something requiring a response.
