            A racial project can be defined as <em>racist</em> if and only if it
            <em
              >creates or reproduces structures of domination based on
              essentialist</em
            ><sup>32</sup> <em>categories of race</em>. Such a definition
            recognizes the importance of locating racism within a fluid and
            contested history of racially based social structures and
            discourses. Thus there can be no timeless and absolute standard for
            what constitutes racism, for social structures change and discourses
            are subject to rearticulation. Our definition therefore focuses
            instead on the "work" essentialism does for domination, and the
            "need" domination displays to essentialize the subordinated.

            <sup>32</sup> Essentialism, it will be recalled, is understood as
            belief in real, true human essences, existing outside or impervious
            to social and historical context.
