            Antonio Gramsci understood [hegemony] as the conditions necessary,
            in a given society, for the achievement and consolidation of rule.
            He argued that hegemony was always constituted by a combination of
            coercion and consent. Although rule can be obtained by force, it
            cannot be secured and maintained, especially in modern society,
            without the element of consent.<sup>1</sup>

            Italian philosopher-theorist Antonio Gramsci conceptualized
            hegemony, as "the 'spontaneous' consent given by the great masses of
            the population to the general direction imposed on social life by
            the dominant fundamental group."<sup>2</sup>
