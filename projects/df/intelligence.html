            Another criticism akin to that just discussed is that the view here
            taken of the work and office of philosophy rests upon a romantic
            exaggeration of what can be accomplished by "intelligence." If the
            latter word were used as a syonym for what one important school of
            past ages called "reason" or "pure intellect," the criticism would
            be more than justified. But the word names something very different
            from what is regarded as the highest organ or "faculty" for laying
            hold of ultimate truths. It is a shorthand designation for great and
            ever-growing methods of observation, experiment and reflective
            reasoning which have in a very short time revolutionized the
            physical and, to a considerable degree, the physiological conditions
            of life, but which have not as yet been worked out for application
            to what is itself distinctively and basically <em>human</em>. It is
            a newcomer even in the physical field of inquiry; as yet it hasn't
            developed in the various aspects of the human scene. The
            reconstruction to be undertaken is not that of applying
            "intelligence" as something ready-made. It is to carry over into any
            inquiry into human and moral subjects the kind of method (the method
            of observation, theory as hypothesis, and experimental test) by
            which understanding of physical nature has been brought to its
            present pitch.<sup>1</sup>
