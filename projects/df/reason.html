            Rather, it provides evidence that the power of judging well and of
            distinguishing the true from the false (which is, properly speaking,

            that there are differences of degree only between
            <em>accidents</em>, but not at all between <em>forms</em> or natures
            of individuals of the same <em>species</em>.<sup>2</sup>
