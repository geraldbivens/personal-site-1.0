            The definition of essentialism has largely been developed in the
            writing of the social constructionists and refers to the view that
            sexual categories and sexual identities represent fixed personal
            characteristics that are inherent, objective, transcultural, and
            transhistorical. Essentialism treats sexuality as a biological force
            underlying genuine sexual differences which in turn serve as the
            basis for sexual categories and identities. In relation to sexual
            orientation, essentialism argues that differences in sexual desire
            create categories of persons known as homosexual and heterosexual
            which are fundamentally the same across time and in different
            cultures.<sup>1</sup>
