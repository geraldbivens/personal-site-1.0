            Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical
            bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then our
            conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the
            object.

            The term [pragmatism] is derived from the same Greek word πράγμα
            [pragma], meaning action, from which our words 'practice' and
            'practical' come. It was first introduced into philosophy by Mr.
            Charles Peirce in 1878. In an article entitled 'How to make Our
            Ideas Clear,' ... Mr. Peirce, after pointing out that our beliefs
            are really rules for action, said that, to develop a thought's
            meaning, we need only determine what conduct it is fitted to
            produced: that conduct is for us its sole significance. And the
            tangible fact at the root of all our thought-distinctions, however
            subtle, is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in
            anything but a possible difference in practice. To attain perfect
            clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider
            what conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may involved
            &mdash; what sensations we are to expect from it, and what reactions
            we must prepare. Our conception of these effects, whether immediate
            or remote, is then for us the whole of our conception of the object,
            so far as that conception has positive significance at all.

            This is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. It lay
            entirely unnoticed by anyone for twenty years, until I ... brought
            it forward again and made a special application of it to religion.
            By that date (1898) the times seemed ripe for its reception. The
            word 'pragmatism' spread, and at present it fairly spots the pages
            of the philosophic journals.
