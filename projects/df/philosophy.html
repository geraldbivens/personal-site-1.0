            ...that philosophy provides the means of speaking plausibly about
            all things and of making oneself admired by the less learned;

            Concerning philosophy I shall say only that, seeing that it has been
            cultivated for many centuries by the most excellent minds that have
            ever lived and that, nevertheless, there still is nothing in it
            about which there is not some dispute, and consequently nothing that
            is not doubtful, I was not at all so presumptuous as to hope to fare
            any better there than the others; and that, considering how many
            opinions there can be about the very same matter that are held by
            learned people without there ever being the possibility of more than
            one opinion being true, I deemed everything that was merely probable
            to be well nigh false.<sup>2</sup>

            Philosophy is not something which originally and by nature is
            present in our spirit without its cooperation. It is thoroughly a
            work of freedom. It is to each only that which he himself has made
            it; and thus even the idea of philosophy is only the result of
            philosophy itself, which as an infinite science is at the same time
            the science of itself.<sup>3</sup>

            Philosophy is therefore the art that presents an image of universal
            existence in concepts.<sup>4</sup>

            I see philosophy not as an <em>a priori</em> propaedeutic or
            groundwork for science, but as continuous with science. I see
            philosophy and science as in the same boat&mdash;a boat which, to
            revert to Neurath's figure as I so often do, we can rebuild only at
            sea while staying afloat in it. There is no external vantage point,
            no first philosophy. All scientific findings, all scientific
            conjectures that are at present plausible, are therefore in my view
            as welcome for use in philosophy as elsewhere.<sup>5</sup>

            I would regard this fact&mdash;that philosophy is one of its own
            normal topics&mdash;as in turn defining for the subject, for what I
            wish philosophy to do. But someone who thinks philosophy is a form
            of science may not accept that definition, because his picture is of
            a difference between, say, speaking about physics and doing physics.
            And this may be not only a special view of philosophy, it may be a
            partial view of science; because certain ways in which certain
            persons talk about a science are a part of the teaching of the
            science, and the ways in which the science is taught and learned may
            be taken as essential to an understanding of what that science
            is.<sup>6</sup>

            I understand it as a willingness to think not about something other
            than what ordinary human beings think about, but rather to learn to
            think undistractedly about things that ordinary human beings cannot
            help thinking about, or anyway cannot help having occur to them,
            sometimes in fantasy, sometimes as a flash across a landscape; such
            things, for example, as whether we can know the world as it is in
            itself, or whether others really know the nature of one's own
            experiences, or whether good and bad are relative, or whether we
            might not now be dreaming that we are awake, or whether modern
            tyrannies and weapons and spaces and speeds and art are continuous
            with the past of the human race or discontinuous, and hence whether
            the learning of the human race is not irrelevant to the problems it
            has brought before itself. Such thoughts are instances of that
            characteristic human willingness to allow questions for itself which
            it cannot answer with satisfaction. Cynics about philosophy, and
            perhaps about humanity, will find that questions without answers are
            empty; dogmatists will claim to have arrived at answers;
            philosophers after my heart will rather wish to convey the thought
            that while there may be no satisfying answers to such questions
            <em>in certain forms</em>, there are, so to speak, directions to
            answers, <em>ways to think</em>, that are worth the time of your
            life to discover.<sup>7</sup>

            Therefore I do not consider the terrain of philosophy to be either a
            professional arena in which playfully to solve technical problems of
            little human consequence or a privileged platform from which to
            oversee the claims of other disciplines. Rather, I understand
            philosophy to be a social activity of intellectual pursuit always
            already infused with cultural concerns and political choices often
            unbeknown to its participants.<sup>8</sup>

          Especially in his last writings Husserl repeatedly testified to the way in which philosophy remained for him something eminently questionable, so questionable, in fact, as to compel him to remain, in a profound sense, a perpetual beginner. In one such testimony he wrote the following:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="indentalt">
          I know, of course, what I am striving for under the title of philosophy, as the goal and field of my work. And yet I do not know. What autonomous thinker has ever been satisfied with this, his "knowledge"? For what autonomous thinker, in his philosophizing life, has "philosophy" ever ceased to be an enigma?<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          If we grant, with Husserl, that philosophy remains an enigma&mdash;and there is perhaps no saying what is required in order really to grant this&mdash;we must, on ther other hand, insist that philosophy's enigmatic character is not something posed once and for all beyond the limit of philosophical questioning, that, on the contrary, this enigmatic character is something which philosophical thought is obliged to take up, even if only to preserve our wonder in the face of that enigma which philosophy is. Philosophy is itself a philosophical problem&mdash;that is, philosophy is a problem for itself, even to such a degree that there belongs to it what Fink aptly calls "the gnawing unrest of an abysmal doubt concerning itself."<sup>2</sup> Philosophy is questionable for itself, and yet the appropriate philosophical response to this questionableness is not simply to acknowledge it but rather to be provoked by it into a renewed questioning. The questionableness of philosophy is not only something negative, not only the lack of a sufficient determination of the nature, possibilities, and limits of philosophy, but also something positive, a questionableness which is such as to provoke questioning. By such questioning philosophy, in turn, testifies to its own questionableness, to that questionableness which is the source both of its poverty and of its richness.

            That something [philosophy] is a practice, like law or religion. Very often it is
            a practice involved with acquiring knowledge&mdash;like physics,
            psychology, history, and the like. But it may also be a practical
            activity, such as ethics. Philosophy begins when the people involved
            in the relevant practices become self-conscious&mdash;when they
            begin to wonder about just what it is that they are doing or just
            what they are really talking about.<sup>9</sup>
