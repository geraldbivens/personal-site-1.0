            Social constructionist inquiry is principally concerned with
            explicating the processes by which people come to describe, explain,
            or otherwise account for the world (including themselves) in which
            they live.<sup>1</sup>

            Social constructionism is a belief both in the primary importance of
            social forces in shaping human behavior and experience, and that
            knowledge is not in fact a reflection of the world, but rather a
            product of discourse.<sup>2</sup>
