            I further suggest that the best model for the evolution of modernist
            painting is that of the dialectic understood as an unceasing process
            of perpetual radical self-criticism or, as I also put it, "perpetual
            revolution"; and I gloss my invocation of the dialectic by insisting
            on the latter's nonteleological nature: thus, I say that "the work
            of such painters as Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, and Frank Stella
            . . . aspires to be judged, in retrospect, to have been necessary to
            the finest modernist painting of the future."<sup>1</sup>
