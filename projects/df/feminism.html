            Most people in the United States think of feminism or the more
            commonly used term "women's lib" as a movement that aims to make
            women the social equals of men. This broad definition popularized by
            the media and mainstream segments of the movement, raises
            problematic questions. Since men are not equals in white
            supremacist, capitalist, patriarchal class structure, which men do
            women want to be equal to? Do women share a common vision of what
            equality means? Implicit in this simplistic definition of women's
            liberation is a dismissal of race and class as factors that, in
            conjunction with sexism determine the extent to which an individual
            will be discriminated against, exploited, or oppressed.<sup>1</sup>

            Feminism is the struggle to end sexist oppression. Its aim is not to
            benefit solely any specific group of women, any particular race or
            class of women. It does not privilege women over men. It has the
            power to transform in a meaningful way all our lives. Most
            importantly, feminism is neither a lifestyle nor a ready-made
            identity or role one can step into.<sup>2</sup>

            Radical feminism is working for the eradication of domination and
            elitism in all human relationships. This would make
            self-determination the ultimate good and require the downfall of
            society as we know it today.<sup>3</sup>
