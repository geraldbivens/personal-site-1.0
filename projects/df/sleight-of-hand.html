            Donald Trump is still playing to suspicions of President Obama. And
            it's no longer theoretical. It's theological. For the detractors,
            truth is no longer dependent on proof because it's rooted in faith:
            faith that American exceptionalism was never truly meant to cover
            hyphenated Americans; faith in 400 years of cemented assumptions
            about the character and capacity of the American Negro; and faith
            that if the president doesn't hew to those assumptions then he must
            be alien by both birth and faith.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is how the moneyed interests&mdash;of whom Trump is
            one&mdash;want it. That is how sleight of hand works: distract and
            deceive. They need this distraction now more than ever because the
            right's flimsy fiscal argument&mdash;that if we allow fat cats to
            gorge, crumbs will surely fall&mdash;is losing traction. . . .

            In 1965, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. described how the
            strategy of separating people with common financial interests by
            agitating their racial differences was used against the populist
            movement at the turn of the century, explaining that "the Southern
            aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow."
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            He continued that Jim Crow was "a psychological bird that told him
            that no matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man,
            better than the black man." He called this "their last outpost of
            psychological oblivion."<sup>1</sup>
