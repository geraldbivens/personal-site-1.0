            But when the soul investigates by itself it passes into the realm of
            what is pure, ever existing, immortal and unchanging, and being akin
            to this, it always stays with it whenever it is by itself and can do
            so; it ceases to stray and remains in the same state as it is in
            touch with things of the same kind, and its experience then is what
            is called wisdom?<sup>1</sup>
