            Now I want to become a bit more technical, and to offer an
            interpretation of the most famous pragmatist doctrine &mdash; the
            pragmatist theory of truth. I want to show how this doctrine fits
            into a more general programme: that of replacing Greek and Kantian
            dualisms between permanent structure and transitory content with the
            distinction between the past and the future. I shall try to show how
            the things which James and Dewey said about truth were a way of
            replacing the task of justifying past custom and tradition by
            reference to unchanging structure with the task of replacing an
            unsatisfactory present with a more satisfactory future, thus
            replacing certainty with hope.<sup>1</sup>

            Truth is what is supposed to distinguish knowledge from
            well-grounded opinion &mdash; from justified belief. But if the true
            is, as James said, 'the name of whatever proves itself to be good in
            the way of belief, and good, too, for definite, assignable, reasons,
            then it is not clear in what respects a true belief is supposed to
            differ from one which is merely justified. So pragmatists are often
            said to confuse truth, which is absolute and eternal, with
            justification, which is transitory because relative to an
            audience.<sup>2</sup>
