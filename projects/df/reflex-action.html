            It means that the acts we perform are always the result of outward
            discharges from the nervous centres, and that these outward
            discharges are themselves the result of impressions from the
            external world, carried in along one or another of our sensory
            nerves.<sup>1</sup>

            But, first of all, let me ask you to linger a moment longer over
            what I have called the reflex theory of mind, so as to be sure that
            we understand it absolutely before going on to consider those of its
            consequences of which I am more particularly to speak. I am not
            quite sure that its full scope is grasped even by those who have
            most zealously promulgated it. I am not sure, for example, that all
            physiologists see that it commits them to regarding the mind as an
            essentially teleological mechanism. I mean by this that the
            conceiving or theorizing faculty&mdash;the mind's middle
            department&mdash;functions
            <em>exclusively for the sake of ends</em> that do not exist at all
            in the world of impressions we receive by way of our senses, but are
            set by our emotional and practical subjectivity altogether.<sup
