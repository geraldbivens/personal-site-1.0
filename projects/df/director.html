            A director is a kind of idea and taste machine; a movie is a series
            of creative and technical decisions, and it's the director's job to
            make the right decisions as frequently as possible. Shooting a movie
            is the worst milieu for creative work ever devised by man. It is a
            noisy, physical apparatus; it is difficult to concentrate&mdash;and
            you have to do it from eight-thirty to six-thirty, five days a week.
            It's not an environment an artist would ever choose to work in. The
            only advantage it has is that you must do it, and you can't
            procrastinate.<sup>1</sup>
