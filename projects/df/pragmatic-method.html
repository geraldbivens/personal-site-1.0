            The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical
            disputes that otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or
            many? — fated or free? — material or spiritual? — here are notions
            either of which may or may not hold good of the world: and disputes
            over such notions are unending. The pragmatic method in such cases
            is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective
            practical consequences. What difference would it practically make to
            any one if this notion rather than that notion were true? If no
            practical difference whatever can be traced, then the alternatives
            mean practically the same thing, and all dispute is idle. Whenever a
            dispute is serious, we ought to be able to show some practical
            difference that must follow from one or the other's being right.

            No particular results then, so far, but only an attitude of
            orientation, is what the pragmatic method means.

            James sometimes spoke of ‘the pragmatic method’, but this meant
            little more than the insistence on pressing the anti-Platonist
            question, ‘Does our purported theoretical difference make any
            difference to practice?’ That insistence was not so much the
            employment of a method as the assumption of a sceptical attitude
            towards traditional philosophical problems and vocabularies.
