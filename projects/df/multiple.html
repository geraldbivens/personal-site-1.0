            Interviewer: How would you describe a quality book? What are the
            characteristics?

            Steidl: It must have an individual format that fits the photographs.
            Most of the publishers have a standard format. It’s much cheaper to
            buy the paper for five books, to print and bind them in a standard
            format. You get much lower manufacturing costs than with individual
            formats. Secondly: individuality is key. A paper chosen
            individually, print colours that match the photo and the paper, the
            binding. All that makes the book unique. I don’t describe my books
            as industry products. They are “multiples.” To explain it to your
            listeners: A “multiple” is an idea that is developed by an artist
            but that is carried out by a technical person.<sup>1</sup>
