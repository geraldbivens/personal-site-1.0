          <p>
            The perspective we have adopted is one of existentialist morality.
            Every subject posits itself as a transcendence concretely, through
            projects; it accomplishes its freedom only by perpetual surpassing
            toward other freedoms; there is no other justification for present
            existence than its expansion toward an indefinitely open future.
            Every time transcendence lapses into immanence, there is degradation
            of existence into &quot;in-itself,&quot; of freedom into facticity;
            this fall is a moral fault if the subject consents to it; if this
            fall is inflicted on the subject, it takes the form of frustration
            and oppression; in both cases it is an absolute evil.<sup>1</sup>
