            Violence is the intentional and physically forcible, rather rapid
            infliction of damage, including injuries and death, on people or
            ...their property.<sup>1</sup>

            A possible direction to turn is suggested by a third sense sometimes
            given to the words 'violent' and 'violence'. This is where those
            words are used, in effect, as grammatical relatives of the verb 'to
            violate'. We speak of people "violating" oaths, agreements, rights,
            borders, women, and the neighborhood peace and quiet.<sup>2</sup>
