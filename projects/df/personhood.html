            Let us mean by "a criterion of personhood" a specification of the
            characteristic (or set of characteristics) that is such that (1) no
            being can be a person unless he or she possesses that
            characteristic, (2) any being who possesses that characteristic is a
            person, and (3) it is precisely that characteristic that directly
            confers personhood on whoever possesses it. The person-making
            characteristic, in brief, is that characteristic (or set of
            characteristics) that is common and peculiar to all persons and in
            virtue of which they are persons.<sup>1</sup>
