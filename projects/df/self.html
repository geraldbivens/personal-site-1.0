            There is an illusion about America, a myth about America to which we
            are clinging which has nothing to do with the lives we lead and I
            don't believe that anybody in this country who has really thought
            about it or really almost anybody who has been brought up against
            it—and almost all of us have one way or another—this collision
            between one's image of oneself and what one actually is is always
            very painful and there are two things you can do about it, you can
            meet the collision head-on and try and become what you really are or
            you can retreat and try to remain what you thought you were, which
            is a fantasy, in which you will certainly perish.<sup>1</sup>
