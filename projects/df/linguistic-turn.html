            It is customary to distinguish the 'classical pragmatists' &mdash;
            Peirce, James and Dewey &mdash; from such living 'neopragmatists' as
            Quine, Goodman, Putnam and Davidson. The break between the two is
            the so-called 'linguistic turn'. This was the turn philosophers took
            when, dropping the topic of experience and picking up that of
            language, they began taking their cure from Frege rather than from
            Locke. In the US, this turn was taken only in the 1940s and 1950s,
            and it was as a result of this turn that James and Dewey ceased to
            be read in American philosophical departments.<sup>1</sup>

            Had [Dewey] read Popper, he would have applauded Popper's
            fallibilism while deploring the dualisms which Popper, like Carnap,
            took for granted. For the logical empiricist movement, of which
            Carnap and Popper were representatives &mdash; the movement which
            was to shove pragmatism brusquely aside, in American departments of
            philosophy, after the Second World War &dash; reinvented the sharp
            Kantian distinctions between fact and value, and between science on
            the one hand and ideology, metaphysics and religion on the other.
            These were distinctions which both James and Dewey had done their
            best to blur. The logical empiricists had, with the help of Frege
            and Russell, linguistified all the old Kantian distinctions which
            Dewey thought Hegel had helped us to overcome. The history of the
            re-dissolution of those distinctions by the neopragmatists, under
            the leadership of Quine, is the story of the re-pragmatization
            &mdash; and thus the de-Kantianizing and the re-Hegelianizing
            &mdash; of American philosophy.<sup>2</sup>
