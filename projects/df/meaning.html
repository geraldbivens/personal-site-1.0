            Wittgenstein's perspicuous quotation from ordinary language is meant
            to remind the foundational epistemologist that language is not a
            system of representation matching up words and things, a system
            whose faults, paradoxes, and rough places might be smoothed away so
            that a regular structure of representation might be established or,
            as in deconstruction or skepticism, subverted. Meaning is not a
            matter of justified representation but of responsible use, of
            activity. And it is the rough places that allow language to operate,
            the gear to mesh.<sup>1</sup>

            You know, there are so many things that happen that you don't know
            the meaning of at the time; they acquire meaning only after a long
            time. They <em>may</em> acquire meaning after a time.<sup>2</sup>

            It says what it means: it <em>is</em> what it means. The isness of
            meaning is what the purpose of a line of a poem should be.<sup
