            In order to attack that notion [the notion that knowing X is a matter of being 
            related to something <em>intrinsic</em> to X, whereas using X is a matter of 
            standing in an <em>extrinsic</em>, accidental, relation to X], they need to 
            break down the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic â€” between the inner 
            core of X and a peripheral area of X which is constituted by the fact that X 
            stands in certain relations to the other items which make up the universe. The 
            attempt to break down this distinction is what I shall call 
            antiessentialism.<sup>1</sup>
