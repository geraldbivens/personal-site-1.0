            There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists. Once
            these were men who took coloured earth and roughed out the forms of
            a bison on the wall of a cave; today some buy their paints, and
            design posters for the hoardings; they did and do many other things.
            There is no harm in calling all these activities art as long as we
            keep in mind that such a word may mean very different things in
            different times and places, and as long as we realize that Art with
            a capital A has no existence.<sup>1</sup>
