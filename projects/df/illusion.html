            It will be found if we fix our attention on the psychical origin of
            religious ideas. These, which profess to be dogmas, are not the
            residue of experience or the final result of reflection; they are
            illusions, fulfilments of the oldest, strongest and most insistent
            wishes of mankind; the secret of their strength is the strength of
            these wishes.

            When I say that they are illusions, I must define the meaning of the
            word. An illusion is not the same as an error, it is indeed not
            necessarily an error. . . . It is characteristic of the illusion
            that it is derived from men's wishes; in this respect it approaches
            the psychiatric delusion, but it is to be distinguished from this,
            quite apart from the more complicated structure of the latter. In
            the delusion we emphasize as essential the conflict with reality;
            the illusion need not be necessarily false, that is to say,
            unrealizable or incompatible with reality. . . . Thus we call a
            belief an illusion when wish-fulfillment is a prominent factor in
            its motivation, while disregarding its relations to reality, just as
            the illusion itself does.<sup>1</sup>
