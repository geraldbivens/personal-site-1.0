            The esthetic is the clarified and intensified development of traits
            that belong to every normally complete experience.

            That which distinguishes an experience as esthetic is conversion of
            resistance and tensions, of excitations that in themselves are
            temptations to diversion, into a movement toward an inclusive and
            fulfilling close.<sup>2</sup>

            An object is peculiarly and dominantly esthetic, yielding the
            enjoyment characteristic of esthetic perception, when the factors
            that determine anything which can be called <em>an</em> experience
            are lifted high above the threshold of perception and are made
            manifest for their own sake.<sup>3</sup>
