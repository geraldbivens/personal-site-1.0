            A <em>sufficient condition</em> is a condition that guarantees that
            a statement is true (or that a phenomenon will occur). For instance,
            <em>Fido's being a dog</em> guarantees that he is an animal. By
            contrast, <em>Fido's being an animal</em> does not guarantee that he
            is a dog, for he might be some other kind of animal. The
            <em>antecedent</em> (if-clause) of a true conditional statement
            provides a sufficient condition for the truth for the
            <em>consequent</em> (then-clause).<sup>1</sup>

            A sufficient condition for some state of affairs S is a condition
            that, if satisfied, guarantees that S obtains.

            For example, a sufficient condition for getting an A in 341 is
            getting an A on every piece of graded work in the course. This means
            that if a student gets an A on every piece of graded work in the
            course, then the student gets an A.

          <p>
            Handing in a term paper is not a sufficient condition for getting an
            A in the course. It is possible to hand in a term paper and not to
            get an A in the course.<sup>2</sup>
