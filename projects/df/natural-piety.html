            Our successes are dependent upon the cooperation of nature. The
            sense of the dignity of human nature is as religious as is the sense
            of awe and reverence when it rests upon a sense of human nature as a
            co&ouml;perating part of a larger whole. Natural piety is not of
            necessity either a fatalistic acquiescence in natural happenings or
            a romantic idealization of the world. It may rest upon a just sense
            of nature as the whole of which we are parts, while it also
            recognizes that we are parts that are marked by intelligence and
            purpose, having the capacity to strive by their aid to bring
            conditions into greater consonance with what is humanly desirable.
            Such piety is an inherent constituent of a just perspective in
            life.<sup>1</sup>
