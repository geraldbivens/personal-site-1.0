            I don’t believe the problem can be solved by historicizing the
            subject as posited by the phenomenologists, fabricating a subject
            that evolves through the course of history. One has to dispense with
            the constituent subject, to get rid of the subject itself, that’s to
            say, to arrive at an analysis which can account for the constitution
            of the subject within a historical framework. And this is what I
            would call genealogy, that is, a form of history which can account
            for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects,
            etc. without having to make reference to a subject which is either
            transcendental in relation to a field of events or runs in its empty
            sameness throughout the course of history.<sup>1</sup>

            I call this inquiry a "genealogy" because, following the works of
            Friedrich Nietzsche and Michel Foucault, I am interested in the
            emergence <em>(Entstehung)</em> or the "moment of arising" of the
            idea of white supremacy within the modern discourse in the West.<sup
