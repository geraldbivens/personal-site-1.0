            The essential fact of (what I refer to as) the modern lies in the
            relation between the present practice of an enterprise and the
            history of that enterprise, in the fact that this relation has
            become problematic.<sup>1</sup>

            One could say that in a modernist situation "past" loses its
            temporal accent and means anything "not present." Meaning what one
            says becomes a matter of making one's sense present to oneself.

            The basic features of early modern European culture were the
            increasing acceptance of the authority of science, the appearance of
            a new kind of pagan neoclassicism, and the subjectivist turn in
            philosophy.<sup>3</sup>
