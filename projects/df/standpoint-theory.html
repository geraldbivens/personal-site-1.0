            I think certain women are still best suited to elucidate the
            situation of women. ...Yet we know the feminine world more
            intimately than men do because our roots are in it; we grasp more
            immediately what the fact of being female means for a human being,
            and we care more about knowing it. I said that there are more
            essential problems; but this one still has a certain importance from
            our point of view: How will the fact of being women have affected
            our lives? What precise opportunities have been given us, and which
            ones have been denied? What destiny awaits our younger sisters, and
            in which direction should we point them?<sup>1</sup>
