            Ethnicity is the bearer of culture. It describes that aspect of our
            heritage that provides us with a mother tongue and that shapes our
            values, our worldview, our family structure, our rituals, the foods
            we eat, our mating behavior, our music&mdash;in short, much of our
            daily lives. We embody our ethnicity without regard for the presence
            or absence of other ethnic groups. Of course, ethnic groups
            influence one another in myriad ways, and more than occasionally
            come into conflict. But they do not need each other to exist.<sup
