            Existentialism is a primarily European philosophical movement that
            flourished around the middle of the 20th century. Although
            existentialism is a 20th-century movement, the founders of
            existentialist philosophy were both 19th-century
            figures&mdash;S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) and Friedrich
            Nietzsche (1844-1900)&mdash;whose philosophical principles did not
            take root in mainstream academic philosophy until the 20th century.<!-- p 1 -->
            ...Although commentators have attempted to define existentialism in
            a variety of ways, a useful way to approach it is to focus on a
            basic <em>irrationalism</em> shared by existentialist thinkers. To
            understand this irrationalism, and thus to give ourselves a
            preliminary definition of existentialism we must first understand
            the type of rationalism that existentialist irrationalism opposed.<!-- p 2 -->
            ...In opposition to the Platonist claim that things in the world are
            what they are in accordance with rational, unambiguous principles,
            that the world is rational, and thus that ambiguities in the world
            are merely apparent; the existentialist claims that things
            <em>really are</em> ambiguous, that there are no unambiguous
            principles constituting that world&mdash;the world, for the
            existentialist, is irrational.<sup>1</sup>
