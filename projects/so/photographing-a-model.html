                    "When you shoot a girl, you've got to be very concerned with the light on her face. You don't want it to be harsh; you want it to be direct and low, so there's not a whole lot of time. That kind of light only lasts for about 20 minutes in the morning, maybe a half-hour in the evening." Other than that, he explained, "You've got [to] douse lighting—to take light off—or use a backlight. That's one of the things you have to be aware of, using a strobe that turns the light to a light gray value."<sup>1</sup>
