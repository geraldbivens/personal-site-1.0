                    Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, “What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within?” my friend suggested,—”But these impulses may be from below, not from above.” I replied, “They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil’s child, I will live then from the Devil.” No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, ‘Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper; be good-natured and modest; have that grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. They love afar is spite at home.’ Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it,—else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached, as the counteraction of the doctrine of love, when that pules and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, <em>Whim</em>. I hope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude company. Then again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they <em>my</em> poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots, and the thousand-fold Relief Societies—though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar, which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.<sup>1</sup>

                    "What do you want to do?" I asked him.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "I’m going to be a musician," he said.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    For he had graduated, in the time I had been away, from dancing to the juke box to finding out who was playing what, and what they were doing with it, and he had bought himself a set of drums.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "You mean, you want to be a drummer?" I somehow had the feeling that being a drummer might be all right for other people but not for my brother Sonny.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "I don’t think," he said, looking at me very gravely, "that I’ll ever be a good drummer. But I think I can play a piano."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    I frowned. I’d never played the role of the older brother quite so seriously before, had scarcely ever, in fact, 
                    <em>asked</em> Sonny a damn thing. I sensed myself in the presence of something I didn’t really know how to handle, didn’t understand. So I made my frown a little deeper as I asked: "What kind of musician do you want to be?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    He grinned. "How many kinds do you think there are?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Be <em>serious</em>," I said.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    He laughed, throwing his head back, and then looked at me. "I <em>am</em> serious."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Well, then, for Christ’s sake, stop kidding around and answer a serious question, I mean, do you want to be a concert pianist, you want to play classical music and all that, or–or what?" Long before I finished he was laughing again. "For Christ’s <em>sake</em>, Sonny!"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    He sobered, but with difficulty. "I’m sorry. But you sound so–<em>scared</em>!" and he was off again.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Well, you may think it’s funny now, baby, but it’s not going to be so funny when you have to make a living at it, let me tell you <em>that</em>." I was furious because I knew he was laughing at me and I didn’t know why.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "No," he said, very sober now, and afraid, perhaps, that he’d hurt me, "I don’t want to be a classical pianist. That isn’t what interests me. I mean"–he paused, looking hard at me, as though his eyes would help me to understand, and then gestured helplessly, as though perhaps his hand would help–"I mean, I’ll have a lot of studying to do, and I’ll have to study <em>everything</em>, but, I mean, I want to play <em>with</em>–jazz musicians." He stopped. "I want to play jazz," he said.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    Well, the word had never before sounded as heavy, as real, as it sounded that afternoon in Sonny’s mouth. I just looked at him and I was probably frowning a real frown by this time. I simply couldn’t see why on earth he’d want to spend his time hanging around nightclubs, clowning around on bandstands, while people pushed each other around a dance floor. It seemed–beneath him, somehow. I had never thought about it before, had never been forced to, but I suppose I had always put jazz musicians in a class with what Daddy called "good-time people."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Are you <em>serious</em>?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Hell, <em>yes</em>, I’m serious."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    He looked more helpless than ever, and annoyed, and deeply hurt.
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    I suggested, helpfully: "You mean–like Louis Armstrong?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    His face closed as though I’d struck him. "No. I’m not talking about none of that old-time, down home crap."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Well, look, Sonny, I’m sorry, don’t get mad. I just don’t altogether get it, that’s all. Name somebody–you know, a jazz musician you admire."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Bird."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Who?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Bird! Charlie Parker! Don’t they teach you nothing in the goddamn army?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    I lit a cigarette. I was surprised and then a little amused to discover that I was trembling. "I’ve been out of touch," I said. "You’ll have to be patient with me. Now. Who’s this Parker character?'
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "He’s just one of the greatest jazz musicians alive," said Sonny, sullenly, his hands in his pockets, his back to me. "Maybe <em>the</em> greatest," he added, bitterly, "that’s probably why <em>you</em> never heard of him."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "All right," I said, "I’m ignorant. I’m sorry. I’ll go out and buy all the cat’s records right away, all right?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "It don’t," said Sonny, with dignity, "make any difference to me. I don’t care what you listen to. Don’t do me no favors."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    I was beginning to realize that I’d never seen him so upset before. With another part of my mind I was thinking that this would probably turn out to be one of those things kids go through and that I shouldn’t make it seem important by pushing it too hard. Still, I didn’t think it would do any harm to ask: "Doesn’t all this take a lot of time? Can you make a living at it?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    He turned back to me and half leaned, half sat, on the kitchen table. "Everything takes time," he said, "and–well, yes, sure, I can make a living at it. But what I don’t seem to be able to make you understand is that it’s the only thing I want to do."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "Well, Sonny," I said, gently, "you know people can’t always do exactly what they <em>want</em> to do–"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "<em>No</em>, I don’t know that," said Sonny, surprising me. "I think people <em>ought</em> to do what they want to do, what else are they alive for?"
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "You getting to be a big boy," I said desperately, "it’s time you started thinking about your future."
                </p>
		        <p class="indent">
                    "I’m thinking about my future," said Sonny, grimly. "I think about it all the time."<sup>2</sup>
